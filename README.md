This project is a frontend prototype of an e-commerce website called FillCart, built using React.js and styled with modern CSS to provide a clean, user-friendly, and responsive interface. So far, the key features implemented include a top navigation bar with the brand logo, a search bar for product queries, a login button, and a cart icon. The homepage showcases a full-width image carousel displaying promotional banners such as "Mega Mobile Deals – Up to 40% OFF," with navigation arrows to browse through multiple slides. Below the carousel, a responsive product section presents product cards featuring images, names, and price categories, highlighting items like bestselling kurtas, Tokyo Talkies bags, women’s sports shoes, and Radhe crockery sets. The site also includes a footer containing copyright information © 2025 FillCart E-Commerce, along with links to the Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Contact Us pages. The project emphasizes responsive design principles and leverages React.js with custom CSS styling to create a seamless user experience.
